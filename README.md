# FBI-gun-data-project
A project on chances of buying a gun or an explosive in US: Using the FBI gun and US census data, I found that among all the states in the US, an applicant in Kentucky had the highest chance of being issued with a gun and other explosives

## Dataset

This project is about the Analysis of data from FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The data is used by gun shops to check if a person is eligible to buy a firearm or an explosive. I have investigated how different variables affect a person's eligibility to buy a firearm or an explosive in US. I have also used the US census data to get an insite on how the population relates to the gun data.

Therefore, I have invesigated two data sets, the gun_data.xlsx data and the U.S. Census Data.csv data.

The source of the two data sets comes from github.

## Summary of Findings

We have found that there is a very steep trend in the increase of purchase of guns and explosives with respect to time.The limitation of the project is that, we cannot attribute this to any variable that we analysed.Another result is that Kenturky has the highest of about 76% of buying a gun or an explosive. The second state is Indiana whose chance is 14% way much below than Kenturky. In the other states, there is less than 8% chance of one being allowed to buy or purchase the gun or explosive. On the other hand, **New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont** and **Oklahoma** have zero chance of one buying a gun or an explosive. This implies the four states have very low, almost no chance of buying a gun or explosive. 

I also found that, **poverty level, Per capita income,  the population estimates** and  **Total employment** have a weak positive correlation with the **chance of one getting a permit**. These variable can weakly approximate the chance of one buying a gun or an explosive. A limitation of this finding is that the conclusion is based on correlation only. In fact, on visual correlation rather than numeric which may not be perfect one.


## Limitations

One of the limitation of the project was that the *census data* provided was not sufficient to enable me analyse for the correlations between the the **chance of getting a permit** and with **poverty level, Per capita income,  the population estimates** and  **Total employment** from 1988 to 2017. This is because the *gun data* had data from 1988 to 2017 while the *census data* had data for 2016 and 2010 which were not sufficient. On the hand other information such as total employment and poverty level was based on 2015 and not 2016, a year we used to represent the population of the states. Therefore, the results does not give a bigger picture of all these 30 years but merely one year.
Another limitation is that the correlation analysis is based on visualization only rather than visualization and modeling to find a regression function. This is a limitation because we cannot understand the degree of correlation and the significance of the variables that I used in analysis.
